          Rob Halverson's first artist book collects his various titles, texts,
          poems, and lists written between 1999 â€“ 2018. Entirely conceived and
          designed by Halverson the book shares pure text removed from any visual
          works or exhibitions they were previously attached to in hopes of
          showing multiple lives each writing can harbor. These different lives
          layer our sense of the effects of passing time, perception, daily
          personal narratives, meditations on routine and production, notions of
          work, value, reflection, observation, death, digital data processing,
          environment, totaling in emotional and intellectual experiences as a
          series of realizations.
